Ever since then I participated in the Cross country and Track & Field teams from Middle School through High School. There pursuits went well for me in the later stage when I quit Cross Country and began taking the Decathlon seriously. I placed my achievements online and with the help of the ACT score I was accepted into SAU as a student athlete. Over the course of the following 5 years I would not only become the captain of the Multi division of the team, but sucessfully broke the program record on 3 different occasions.  </b></p> </div>
